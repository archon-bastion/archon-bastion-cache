            <h2>Setania</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="body_02">
                I dreamt of a dormant village,
            </p>
            <p>
                Situated in the wooded region of a great world. Annular chain of clouds
                encircling a cobalt moon overhead. I dreamt of the deafening joy within an enclosed star, swallowed by
                the charcoal-silted clutches of a black hole. Trailing rainbow-streams entwined with pentacles of colored
                light; immolated, wreathed in flame. The last sparks of a sun reduced to embers; faint as a single thread
                of gossamer, vestiges of a once-smoldering vitality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Structure emerges from the anticipatory; embedded in the release of a held breath. In the moments before a
                book is closed, the vowels of memory espouse the gestures of the past. The rhythm of life is slower than the
                pulse of blood, yet faster than the candle's wane. In the lacuna of a moment's irresolution, we are to be made
                whole or undone by a quickened heart.
            </p>
            <p>
                So dream, dream, dream. Wash away the blood, wash away the dirt. Look, at all that men have wrought. Wash your
                hands in the river; her specious stream-waters languish on. Coy bed veiled below, here brutish boulders render
                formless, and even the roughest icons weather her mute touch not. Violent figures dispersed as the seeds of a
                new spring. With each season's quiet approach comes a gradual; but sure, erasure of the past. Even as her vague
                shores swirl with the faintest traces of memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only within sleep's rich and mysterious fiefdom, can thoughts of vexation be swept away into airy oblivion.
                A petrified instant: terminal tress of an infinite braid, cleaved-off sliver of chaos. The grand spiral stilled
                by the eye of Setania, to be rewoven and made anew.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, I dream of her as she was. Streams of silver through my hands, weaving me a gown of aqueous thread, a
                silken curtain interlaced with gold. Blue muslin ribbons in my hair and lilies scattered at my feet, I am
                dressed in the gilded raiment of the primal dream. The slowest of agonies against a bitter caress; upon me
                the world is gathered. Whispers left in the dark, a timeless grief, the utter resignation of the past. When
                all is still and empty of thought, what then is that which observes the primal stirrings, as pensive shadows
                crawl across the illumined. The grandeur of a landscape no longer marred. - Walls of ancient stone now dust,
                now lost. Along the river's bank, a river's dust shall I be, and a river's dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                So dream, dream, dream. Wash away the blood, wash away the dirt. Look, at all that men have wrought. Wash your
                hands in the river; her specious stream-waters languish on. For one day soon all will be made new; in the
                crescent glow of fading rose-light and falling snow. A time of spring will come to you once more; like warmth
                returning to an old friend's smile.
            </p>
